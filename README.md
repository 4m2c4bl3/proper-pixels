# Proper Pixels
A Foundry VTT mod to modify the scaling of tokens to use with pixelart

This mod works when the token is created and when the canvas is loaded, if for some reason it doesn't work, just delete the token and place it again, this has happened to me once.

Theres currently no configuration since I didn't think it'd need and didn't want to go through the process of adding that since this is my first time doing a mod, if its needed, do let me know

### Proper Pixels behavior

This one looks way better but gif compression is doing its thing

The animated token is a webm file

### Tagger Blacklist
Using [Tagger](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Tagger) you can create a tag that disables Proper Pixels from applying to that token. Simply ensure the tag name you apply to your token is the same as the one set in Proper Pixel's config.
