# Proper Pixels
A Foundry VTT mod to modify the scaling of tokens to use with pixelart

This mod works when the token is created and when the canvas is loaded, if for some reason it doesn't work, just delete the token and place it again, this has happened to me once.

Theres currently no configuration since I didn't think it'd need and didn't want to go through the process of adding that since this is my first time doing a mod, if its needed, do let me know
